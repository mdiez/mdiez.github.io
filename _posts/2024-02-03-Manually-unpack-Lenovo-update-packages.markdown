# Deepdive into the Lenovo update packages format
Lenovo is supplying the drivers in exe files which can easily be unpacked in Windows (by double-clicking), but if you're working under another operating system, you'll have a harder time. Let's figure out what's contained in these files and how they work.
## 7zip
A quick analysis with 7z shows gives the following output:

`$ 7z l R22UJ60W.exe`
```

```

The following line is of particular interest:
```Comments: This installation was built with Inno Setup.```

It seems that Lenovo is packaging its updates with Inno Setup.

## binwalk
We can also use `binwalk` to learn more about the structure of the file:

`$ binwalk R22UJ60W.exe`
```

```

This shows that there are multiple archives nested in the `exe` file.

# How to manually extract the update package
There is an excellent tool called `innoextract`. You can find more information about it on its [website](https://constexpr.org/innoextract/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract).
Now, in order to extract the update file, follow the steps:
1. Install `innoextract` from its source code or one of the ready-made packages, both can be found on [this webpage](https://constexpr.org/innoextract/#packages).
2. Open a new shell/terminal and run the command
`innoextract <exe update file>`, e.g., `innoextract R22UJ60W.exe`.
3. The utility will extract the contents of the update package to a subdirectory in the current directory. In my case, the directory was called `code$GetExtractPath$`.

If you intend to update or downgrade your Lenovo machine's BIOS under Linux, please read the [follow-up blogpost](/it/2024/02/03/Lenovo-BIOS-update-downgrade-under-Linux.html).
